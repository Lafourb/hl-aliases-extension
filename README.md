### Importing Aliases

You can import aliases in several ways:

- **Local File**: Use "Load Local File" to import a JSON file with your custom aliases
- **Hypurrscan localStorage**: Navigate to hypurrscan.io and click "Import from localStorage" to import all aliases you've created or customized on Hypurrscan. This imports both standard aliases and any custom naming you've done on the platform.

### JSON Format

When importing from a local file, use the following format:

```json
{
  "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890": "Trader1",
